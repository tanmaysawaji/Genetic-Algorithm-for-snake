This code can undergo a lot of improvements as the logic used for selection, crossover and the fitness function is very basic

The neural network used for making predictions is structured randomly and the inputs taken can be improved

The reason for me to write this code was that I have always read about genetic algorithm in theory but I had never seen it implemented practically

I had a lot of doubts on the topic which were solved when I decided to tackle this problem

This is a very rudimentary implementation of the algorithm and its only purpose is to educate anyone interested in the topic

The code for snake game is not written by me, I have used the code from https://gist.github.com/sanchitgangwar/2158089
